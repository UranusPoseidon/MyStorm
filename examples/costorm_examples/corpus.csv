"Hurricane Hilary was a large and powerful Pacific hurricane in August 2023 that brought torrential rainfall and gusty winds to the Pacific Coast of Mexico, the Baja California Peninsula, and the Southwestern United States, resulting in widespread flooding and mudslides. The cyclone was the eighth named storm, sixth hurricane, and fourth major hurricane of the 2023 Pacific hurricane season.[nb 1] Hilary originated from a tropical wave south of Mexico on August 16, and strengthened into a hurricane a day later while paralleling the southwest coast of Mexico. The hurricane underwent rapid intensification, reaching maximum sustained winds of 140 mph (220 km/h) and a central pressure of 940 mbar (27.76 inHg) on August 18, making it a Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson scale. After environmental conditions became unfavorable, Hilary weakened as it approached land, making landfall on August 20 as a tropical storm in San QuintÂ¨Âªn along the western Baja California peninsula. Hilary became a post-tropical cyclone over land, before being absorbed into a new non-tropical low-pressure area early on August 21.

The threat from Hurricane Hilary prompted widespread and varied preparations. In Mexico, thousands of people evacuated to shelters as ports closed along the coast. In anticipation of ""catastrophic and life-threatening flooding"", the National Hurricane Center (NHC) issued its first-ever tropical storm warning for Southern California, extending from the MexicoÂ¨CUnited States border to just north of Los Angeles. The Weather Prediction Center and various National Weather Service offices issued forecasts related to the rainfall potential, affecting about 26 million people across Arizona, California, Nevada, and Utah.

In Mexico, the hurricane killed three people and left at least 250 million pesos (US$14.7 million) in damage.[nb 2] Power outages affected 315,929 people in the country, although most service was restored within four days. The storm left behind flooded roads, mudslides and downed trees in the Baja California peninsula and in Southern California. Some areas of the latter region received up to 600% of their annual rainfall averages for the month of August. The floods killed one person in San Bernardino County, California. The estimated damage total in the United States was US$900 million, much of it in Inyo County, California, where most of the roads in Death Valley National Park were damaged by floods. The park was closed for two months, its longest ever closure.

"2022 Crimean Bridge explosion was an event during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, on 8 October 2022, at 6:07 a.m., when a fire broke out on the Crimean Bridge as a result of an explosion of a bomb loaded onto a truck, which occurred on the road bridge, on the westbound vehicle lanes running from Russia to Kerch in Russian-occupied Crimea. Two two-lane vehicular spans of the bridge collapsed into the water. Two adjacent eastbound lanes on a separate structure survived. The railway bridge was also damaged by a railway tanker car that caught fire. Five people were killed. Following the incident, the Investigative Committee of Russia launched an investigation.

The damage reduced the transport capacity of the bridge, which is being used to supply Russian troops in Crimea during the invasion of Ukraine. The explosion occurred the day after the 70th birthday of Russian President Vladimir Putin and one week after the announcement of the annexation of four Ukrainian regions by Russia. At the time, no-one claimed responsibility for the explosion and Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that the Ukrainian government ""did not order"" it.[1] However, in July 2023, Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Defense Hanna Maliar acknowledged Ukraine had conducted the attack ""in order to break the logistics of the Russians"".[2] The Security Service of Ukraine confirmed that Ukraine was behind the attack.[3]

Russian officials and a ""senior Ukrainian official"" speaking to The New York Times stated the explosion was from a bomb loaded onto a truck.[4] The BBC said it was more likely to have been caused by a maritime drone.[5] The Russian Federal Security Service detained five Russian citizens and three people from Ukraine and Armenia, who were accused of organising the attack.[6] In August 2023, Vasyl Malyuk, head of the Security Service of Ukraine, gave an interview to The New Voice of Ukraine in which he detailed how a truck carrying explosives was used to cause the explosion.",2022 Crimean Bridge explosion,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Crimean_Bridge_explosion,

"On 2 June 2023, three trains collided in Balasore district in the east Indian state of Odisha. The accident occurred around 19:00 IST when Coromandel Express, a passenger train, collided with a stationary goods train near Bahanaga Bazar railway station on the HowrahÂ¨CChennai main line. Due to the high speed of the passenger train and the heavy tonnage of the goods train, the impact resulted in 21 coaches of the Coromandel Express derailing and three of those collided with the oncoming SMVT BengaluruÂ¨CHowrah Superfast Express on the adjacent track.

296 people were killed in the crash and more than 1,200 were injured. It was one of the deadliest railway accidents in India. National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and Odisha Disaster Rapid Action Force (ODRAF) were involved in the search and recovery efforts, assisted by other government agencies and the general public. The injured were treated at local hospitals in the region. In the aftermath, operations of more than 150 trains were impacted, with the cancellation of at least 48 trains. The rail services resumed on the line on 5 June after restoration work.

Preliminary investigation revealed that the Coromandel Express entered a passing loop line instead of the main line at full speed and crashed into the stationary goods train. In the aftermath, Railway Minister stated that a change in electronic interlocking due to an error in electronic signalling, caused the crash. He also said that sabotage was suspected and the railway board had recommended a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)-led probe. On 7 July 2023, the CBI arrested three railway officials believed to be responsible for the accident.

Despite the statement of the railway authorities that the accident was not a reflection of the safety issues in the system, various questions were raised by journalists, politicians and retired railway employees. The railway lines were not equipped with the Kavach train protection system. It was made aware that a similar signalling error had been reported earlier in February 2023 and a December 2022 report by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India had warned that the safety department of the railways lacked adequate staffing and funding, suffered from misuse of funds and that these could impact the quality of maintenance.",2023 Odisha train collision,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Odisha_train_collision,
"There is a long tradition in classical music of writing music in sets of pieces that cover all the major and minor keys of the chromatic scale. These sets typically consist of 24 pieces, one for each of the major and minor keys (sets that comprise all the enharmonic variants include 30 pieces).

Examples include Johann Sebastian Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier and FrÂ¨Â¦dÂ¨Â¦ric Chopin's 24 Preludes, Op. 28. Such sets are often organized as preludes and fugues or designated as preludes or Â¨Â¦tudes. Some composers have restricted their sets to cover only the 12 major keys or the 12 minor keys; or only the flat keys (Franz Liszt's Transcendental ?tudes) or the sharp keys (Sergei Lyapunov's Op. 11 set). In yet another type, a single piece may progressively modulate through a set of tonalities, as occurs in Ludwig van Beethoven's Two Preludes through all twelve major keys, Op. 39.

The bulk of works of this type have been written for piano solo, but there also exist sets for piano 4-hands; two pianos; organ; guitar; two guitars; flute; recorder; oboe; violin solo; violin and piano; cello solo; cello and piano; voice and piano; and string quartet. There are examples of attempts to write full sets that, for one reason or another, were never completed (Josef Rheinberger's organ sonatas, Dmitri Shostakovich's string quartets, CÂ¨Â¦sar Franck's L'Organiste).",Music written in all major and/or minor keys,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_written_in_all_major_and/or_minor_keys,

"Starship flight test 1 was the maiden flight of the integrated SpaceX Starship launch vehicle. SpaceX performed the flight test on April 20, 2023.[3] The prototype vehicle was destroyed less than four minutes after lifting off from the SpaceX Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas.[4] The vehicle became the most powerful rocket ever flown, breaking the half-century-old record held by the Soviet Union's N1 rocket.[5] The launch was the first ""integrated flight test,"" meaning it was the first time that both the Super Heavy booster and the Starship spacecraft flew together as a fully integrated Starship launch vehicle.[6]

The launch was part of SpaceX's Starship development program, which follows an iterative and incremental approach involving frequent, and often destructive, test flights of prototype vehicles.[7] Before the launch, SpaceX officials said they would measure the mission's success ""by how much we can learn"" and that various planned mission events ""are not required for a successful test"".[8] The flight was generally regarded as having furthered Starship's development, and a variety of public officials congratulated SpaceX, including NASA administrator Bill Nelson and European Space Agency Director General Josef Aschbacher.[9][10]

It was planned for the Starship spacecraft to complete nearly one orbit around the Earth before reentering the atmosphere, performing a controlled landing and splashing down in the Pacific Ocean near Hawaii.[11] The Super Heavy booster was to have performed a similar landing in the Gulf of Mexico, about 20 mi (30 km) off the Texas coast about 8 minutes after liftoff.[11]

The rocket lifted off at 13:33 UTC (8:33 am CDT, local time at the launch site) from SpaceX's private launch site near Boca Chica, Texas. The liftoff damaged the launch pad[12] and its surrounding infrastructure,[13] which SpaceX said was unexpected.[14] Some debris spread into Boca Chica State Park. Three engines did not start or aborted before liftoff, and several others failed during the flight.[15] The vehicle passed max q and entered supersonic flight, but, due to a lack of thrust or thrust vector control, no attempt was made at stage separation.[15] Starship began to tumble, triggering the autonomous flight termination system (AFTS), which took 40 seconds to destroy the vehicle, nearly 4 minutes into the flight.[16][15]

After the test, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) grounded the launch program pending results of a standard Â¡Â°mishap investigationÂ¡Â± overseen by the agency and performed by SpaceX.[17] The FAA said that a return to flight would depend on the agency's determination that future launches would not affect public safety.[18] In August 2023, SpaceX submitted to the FAA the 63 ""corrective actions"" that it would need to take before another Starship launch would be allowed.[19][20][21] Dust scattered by the launch initially caused some health concerns, but was later found by a laboratory to be ordinary beach sand, not posing a health hazard.[17][22]

"Funeral for Yesterday is the fourth studio album by Canadian heavy metal band Kittie, released on February 20, 2007. It was the only album released through the band's own record label, X of Infamy Records, and Merovingian Music (MRV). The album was produced by Jack Ponti, and was recorded at RetroMedia Sound Studios in Red Bank, New Jersey, between July and August 2006. Loosely themed around the band's demise and rebirth following a period of turmoil, the album saw Kittie transition towards a more melodic and accessible sound while retaining some of their heavier sensibilities, and was also noted for its greater focus on clean singing than on the band's previous releases. It was the first Kittie album with guitarist Tara McLeod, and only with bassist Trish Doan.

Funeral for Yesterday received generally favourable reviews from critics, who highlighted the band's newfound chemistry and growth, though its focus on clean singing drew mixed reactions.

"The eukaryotes (/ju??k?rio?ts, -?ts/ yoo-KARR-ee-ohts, -??ts)[4] constitute the domain of Eukaryota or Eukarya, organisms whose cells have a membrane-bound nucleus. All animals, plants, fungi, and many unicellular organisms are eukaryotes. They constitute a major group of life forms alongside the two groups of prokaryotes: the Bacteria and the Archaea. Eukaryotes represent a small minority of the number of organisms, but given their generally much larger size, their collective global biomass is much larger than that of prokaryotes.

The eukaryotes seemingly emerged within the Asgard archaea, and are closely related to the Heimdallarchaeia.[5] This implies that there are only two domains of life, Bacteria and Archaea, with eukaryotes incorporated among the Archaea. Eukaryotes first emerged during the Paleoproterozoic, likely as flagellated cells. The leading evolutionary theory is they were created by symbiogenesis between an anaerobic Asgard archaean and an aerobic proteobacterium, which formed the mitochondria. A second episode of symbiogenesis with a cyanobacterium created the plants, with chloroplasts.

Eukaryotic cells contain membrane-bound organelles such as the nucleus, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the Golgi apparatus. Eukaryotes may be either unicellular or multicellular. In comparison, prokaryotes are typically unicellular. Unicellular eukaryotes are sometimes called protists. Eukaryotes can reproduce both asexually through mitosis and sexually through meiosis and gamete fusion (fertilization).",Eukaryote,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eukaryote,

Mackenzie Ministries, and commonly referred to as the Shakahola cult, is an apocalyptic Christian new religious movement which was founded by Paul Nthenge Mackenzie and his first wife in 2003.[1] Following the deaths of over 400 of its members and their children at the movement's base in Shakahola, Kilifi County, Kenya, the group has been designated by the Kenyan government as an organized criminal group.[2][3] As of August 2024, Mackenzie was on trial, accused of manslaughter, torture and terrorism.[4]

GNIM attracted international attention in April 2023 when it was revealed that Mackenzie had allegedly instructed members to starve themselves en masse to ""meet Jesus,"" resulting in the deaths of over 400 people.[5] The group, widely described[6] as a cult or doomsday cult,[1][2][7][8] is adamantly anti-Western, with amenities such as health care, education, and sports being dismissed as ""evils of western life"" and with Mackenzie condemning the United States, United Nations, and the Catholic Church as ""tools of Satan"". The group devotes much of its teachings to the end times. They were purportedly influenced by the End-Time Message of William Branham.[7][9] Homicide detectives working on the case alleged the group was radicalized by Branham's teachings, leading to their deaths.[10]

Mackenzie founded the GNIM in 2003 and accumulated a sizable following, largely due to convincing his followers that he could speak directly with God.[11] Beginning in the late 2010s, Mackenzie's church began to receive a renewed wave of scrutiny regarding the internal practices of the organization.[12] In 2017, Mackenzie and his wife faced several charges relating to the church. He was chastised for inciting students to abandon their education after denouncing it as ""ungodly"", as well as radicalizing and denying medical care to the children afterwards; several children died as a result and, in 2017, 93 children were rescued by government authorities from the group.[13] After another arrest in 2019, he departed Malindi and headed to the Shakahola forest, where the mass starvation occurred in 2023.

Mackenzie did not join his followers in the mass starvation; a dietary menu was found on the wall in one of the special houses in the forest believed to be his resting room. He was taken into police custody as the process of exhuming the bodies continued,[14] and on January 18, 2024, he was charged with 191 counts of murder. Police authorities claimed that some bodies were missing organs, and believed they were being harvested and sold.[15][16] However, this claim was refuted by Interior Cabinet Secretary Kithure Kindiki on 10 May.[17] As of 8 May, autopsies performed on 112 of the exhumed bodies ruled out the possibility of organ harvesting.[18] The church was on 31st January 2024 declared by the Kenya government as an Â¡Â°organized criminal groupÂ¡Â± under the Prevention of Organized Crimes Act.[3]",Good News International Ministries,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_News_International_Ministries,

"Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storm Mocha[a] (/?mo?k?/) was a powerful and deadly tropical cyclone in the North Indian Ocean which affected Myanmar and parts of Bangladesh in May 2023. The second depression and the first cyclonic storm of the 2023 North Indian Ocean cyclone season, Mocha originated from a low-pressure area that was first noted by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) on 8 May. After consolidating into a depression, the storm tracked slowly north-northwestward over the Bay of Bengal, and reached extremely severe cyclonic storm intensity. After undergoing an eyewall replacement cycle, Mocha rapidly strengthened, peaking at Category 5-equivalent intensity on 14 May with winds of 270 km/h (165 mph). Mocha slightly weakened before making landfall, and its conditions quickly became unfavorable. Mocha rapidly weakened once inland and dissipated shortly thereafter.

Thousands of volunteers assisted citizens of Myanmar and Bangladesh in evacuating as the cyclone approached the international border.[8] Evacuations were also ordered for low-lying areas in Sittwe, Pauktaw, Myebon, Maungdaw, and Buthidaung. In Bangladesh, over 500,000 individuals were ordered to be relocated from coastal areas of the country due to the storm's approach. Officials from the military declared the state of Rakhine a natural disaster area. Several villages in Rakhine State were also damaged by the cyclone. The death toll for Cyclone Mocha varies significantly. ASEAN reported a total of 145 deaths,[9] whereas the National Unity Government of Myanmar (NUG) stated that Cyclone Mocha killed at least 463 people, including three indirect deaths in Bangladesh. The storm also injured 719 people and left 101 others missing.[10][6] It caused about US$2.24 billion of damage in Myanmar.

Elsewhere, thousands of homes were destroyed in Bangladesh. Twelve people were injured, and the agricultural damage there reached ?115 million (US$1.07 million), though impact was less severe than initially feared. Seven people in Sri Lanka were indirectly injured and another seven were reported missing due to the cyclone. In India, 5,749 people across over 50 villages were affected, and at least 236 houses were damaged. The remnants of Mocha then contributed to blizzards in China.",Cyclone Mocha,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Mocha,

"Threads is an online social media and social networking service operated by Meta Platforms. The service features integration with Instagram and users must register for Threads with an Instagram account. Functionally it is similar to Twitter: users can post text, images, voice recordings, and videos, as well as interact with other users' posts through replies, reposts, and likes. The application is available on iOS and Android devices; the web version offers limited functionality and requires a mobile app to be installed first. Upon its launch, Threads became the fastest-growing consumer software application in history, gaining over 100 million users in its first five days and surpassing the record previously set by ChatGPT.[2][3][4] This early success was not sustained, and the user base of the app plummeted more than 80% to 8 million daily active users by the end of July 2023.[5][6][7]

After Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter in October 2022, Meta employees explored the concept of introducing text-based functionality to Instagram. This feature, known as Instagram Notes, was rolled out in December 2022.[8] The company subsequently began developing a separate app focused on text-based posts.
