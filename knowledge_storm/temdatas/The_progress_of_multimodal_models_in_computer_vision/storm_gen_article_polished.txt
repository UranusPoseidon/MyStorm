One of the critical areas of progress has been the utilization of transformer networks, which have demonstrated exceptional power across various tasks since their inception. Although initially transformers exhibited certain incompatibilities with multiple-object tracking (MOT), recent studies have been working towards overcoming these challenges by addressing issues with bounding boxes and sparse queries[5].
Additionally, researchers have developed advanced models such as the Multi-modal Multi-scale Transformer (M2TR). This model employs a multi-scale transformer that operates on patches of varying sizes to detect inconsistencies at different spatial levels. By integrating frequency information with RGB features through a cross-modality fusion module, M2TR enhances the robustness of detection methods, particularly against image compression[6].
In the realm of image captioning, there has been a notable extension of machine translation techniques to the Multimodal Transformer (MT) model. The MT model effectively captures intra- and inter-modal interactions within a unified attention block, enabling complex multimodal reasoning and the production of accurate image captions. This approach signifies a substantial leap in the field by improving upon traditional image captioning methods[7].
Moreover, substantial progress has been made in multimodal representation learning, particularly with applications in the medical domain. For instance, the Medical Vision Language Learner (MedViLL) extends the BERT architecture to accommodate multi-modal pre-training objectives. This advancement allows for superior performance in vision-language tasks, such as processing radiology images alongside their corresponding unstructured reports[8].

In particular, vision-based motion estimation and 3D reconstruction are gaining significant attention for their applications in autonomous driving, navigation systems for airborne devices, and augmented reality[2]. These technologies benefit from the use of large field-of-view cameras, which enhance accuracy and robustness in dynamic environments[2].
In the medical field, multimodal models play a crucial role in tasks such as image registration, which aids in disease detection, diagnosis, and staging, as well as in image-guided surgery and therapy[15][16]. These models address complex mathematical problems that arise in clinical applications, contributing to improved patient care[15][16]. Additionally, advancements in computer-aided diagnosis methods, such as MDNet, enable more interpretable and visually meaningful model predictions by establishing a direct multimodal mapping between medical images and diagnostic reports[17].
Moreover, multimodal models have shown impressive performance in vision-language tasks, like image captioning and visual question answering, by extending architectures like BERT with multi-modal pre-training objectives. This approach has been particularly impactful in the medical domain, where models like Medical Vision Language Learner (MedViLL) leverage radiology images and unstructured reports to enhance diagnostic processes[4][8].
These advancements illustrate the potential of multimodal models to generalize beyond their initial environments and address a wide array of real-world applications, from improving healthcare outcomes to enhancing autonomous systems[18][19].

# Challenges and Limitations

Multimodal models in computer vision have shown remarkable success across various applications, yet they encounter several challenges and limitations in real-world scenarios. One major challenge is the deployment of deeper models, which often offer superior performance but are difficult to implement effectively. Knowledge distillation is a potential solution that allows the training of smaller models with minimal performance loss, although it remains a complex task to manage [20].
Moreover, these models must be capable of handling open set samples, which originate from classes outside those they were initially trained on. This ability to identify novel inputs is crucial for maintaining the robustness of computer vision systems in dynamic environments [20]. Another significant challenge lies in robust multiple model fitting, particularly due to the unknown number of models and the inlier noise scale. These factors typically require auxiliary information or ground-truth data provided by the user, which can be difficult to obtain [21][22].
The issue of class imbalance further complicates the training of computer vision models, particularly in tasks like recognizing human visual attributes. This imbalance, combined with a lack of spatial annotations, poses additional hurdles that current methods struggle to overcome effectively [23]. Social biases also pose a limitation, as they can adversely influence outcomes in applications such as image captioning, where biases may propagate through datasets like COCO, affecting the fairness and accuracy of the model outputs [24].
Finally, multimodal models often exhibit overfitting when trained on publicly available datasets, as evidenced in applications like driver drowsiness detection. Such overfitting can result in racial bias, indicating the need for more representative datasets and innovative visualization techniques to address these biases [14]. Overall, addressing these challenges is critical to advancing the reliability and applicability of multimodal models in computer vision.

# Ethical Considerations

The development and deployment of multimodal models in computer vision have raised significant ethical concerns, particularly regarding bias and fairness. Algorithmic decision systems, which underpin these models, have often been criticized as "biased," "racist," "sexist," or "unfair" by media outlets, organizations, and researchers[25]. This has sparked a debate about the validity of such claims and the implications for citizens and policymakers[25]. The concerns are especially pertinent in the realm of biometric technologies, which are increasingly integrated into personal and commercial contexts[25].
Moreover, the issue of bias is not only a societal concern but also a technical one. Modern machine learning models, despite their impressive accuracy in specific visual recognition tasks such as those on the ImageNet dataset, are influenced by the data they are trained on and the inductive biases inherent in their design[26][27]. These biases can be challenging to characterize and can inadvertently propagate through various applications, such as image captioning, potentially leading to undesirable social biases[24].
Image captioning, for instance, is a crucial task for both benchmarking visual reasoning and enhancing accessibility for people with vision impairments. However, it has been shown that social biases can infiltrate these systems, affecting their performance and fairness[24]. This is evident in the gender bias observed in the captions generated by models trained on datasets like COCO, where gender labels are automatically derived[24].
Given these ethical challenges, it is crucial for researchers and developers in the field of computer vision to prioritize fairness and transparency in model development. This includes conducting thorough evaluations of models for bias and implementing mechanisms to mitigate these biases to ensure that the advancements in multimodal models benefit all users equitably.

# Future Directions

The development of multimodal models in computer vision has shown substantial promise, particularly in tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering. Recent studies have leveraged the BERT architecture, enhancing it with multi-modal pre-training objectives to achieve impressive results in these areas[4][8]. Looking forward, there are several exciting directions for further research and development.
One potential avenue is the application of these multimodal models to real-world environments, which present unique challenges for deep learning-based computer vision techniques[20]. While deeper models have demonstrated improved performance, they are often difficult to deploy. Future work could focus on the implementation of knowledge distillation methods to train smaller, more efficient models without significant loss in performance[20].
Additionally, the ability of models to generalize across different types of multi-rigid-body dynamic systems using only a 3D model is an area ripe for exploration[18][19]. This capability could extend the applicability of multimodal models beyond current constraints, enabling more robust interactions within diverse real-world scenarios.
In the medical domain, the exploration of multimodal representation learning tasks using radiology images and unstructured reports represents a promising direction[4][8]. For instance, the proposed Medical Vision Language Learner (MedViLL) aims to enhance the understanding of complex medical data, which could revolutionize diagnostic processes[4][8].
Finally, the challenge of open set recognition, where models encounter samples from classes outside their training set, is an ongoing issue. Future research may focus on developing techniques to effectively identify and adapt to these novel classes, further increasing the robustness of multimodal models in dynamic and unpredictable environments[20].
These directions highlight the potential of multimodal models to transform not only computer vision tasks but also broader applications across various domains.
